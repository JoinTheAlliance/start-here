The Alliance is a metaorganization which promotes and connects individuals and companies working toward making the future better than the present for everyone. We maintain open source technology, support mission-aligned projects and build a new culture together.

If you have your own company, community or philosophical movement, you are welcome to represent that in The Alliance. The only requirement is that whatever your are building and promoting be aligned with our mission of making human lives better and not worse.

## Our Mission

Our mission is to make direct ontributions to humanity which have widespread positive impact. We harness technology to create products, apps, and research that bring people together, enhance quality of life, and ensure a brighter future for everyone. Positive contributions include applications like AI agents that foster human connections. In contrast, we steer clear of initiatives that lead to isolation or distraction.

## Our Current Work

We maintain a series of packages which enable new kinds of products to be built. Most of this focus is on natural language interfaces, LLM pipelines and AI agents.

Key projects include:
