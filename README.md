The Alliance is a metaorganization aiming to promote and connect individuals and companies working toward making the future better than the present for everyone. We maintain open source technology, support mission-aligned projects and build a new culture together.

If you have your own company, community or philosophical movement, you are welcome to represent that in The Alliance. The only requirement is that whatever your are building and promoting be aligned with our mission of making human lives better and not worse.

## Our Current Work

We maintain a series of packages which enable new kinds of products to be built. Most of this focus is on natural language interfaces, LLM pipelines and AI agents.

If you have a proposal or idea, reach out to any role holder on Discord for a discussion. Alternatively, you can peruse our role suggestions to find something that fits your expertise and interests.

### Technical Roles

##### Architect
As a senior engineering role, an Architect shoulders the responsibility for building and maintaining the packages and projects, reviewing contributor submissions, and determining the project's direction. This role involves a high degree of responsibility and autonomy.

Suggested tasks:
- Review the current architecture of packages and identify areas for improvement.
- Construct systems and processes for onboarding and managing contributors.
- Tackle fundamental and technically challenging problems within the project.

##### Contributor
This is a role suitable for junior and intermediate engineers. As a Contributor, you'll help build and maintain packages and projects, and submit pull requests for review.

Suggested Tasks:
- Review code and tests to ensure all packages achieve 100% testing coverage.
- Write and review existing documentation for typos or inaccuracies.
- Craft tutorials and examples for using the packages.
- Write unit tests for code.
- Improve existing code, resolve issue tickets, and submit PRs for review.

##### Researcher
This role calls for an engineering or computer science background. Researchers are responsible for exploring and implementing new ideas and algorithms for the project, as well as constructing methods to verify results and track improvements or regressions.

Suggested Tasks:
- Prepare and implement benchmarking systems to measure progress.
- Incorporate existing benchmarking tools and develop new ones as necessary.
- Create reliable and repeatable methods for monitoring progress.
- Investigate new ideas and algorithms and implement them in the project.

##### External Evaluator

The External Evaluator role is an integral part of our ecosystem. While not directly involved in the development process, these individuals use our packages in their projects, providing valuable real-world feedback on their effectiveness, usability, and possible areas of improvement. Their perspective is crucial in ensuring our packages are useful and user-friendly outside the context of our own development.

Suggested Tasks:

- Use our packages in your own projects and provide feedback on their performance, usability, and functionality.
- Identify and report bugs, unexpected behavior, or inconsistencies in our packages.
- Suggest enhancements or new features based on your experience using the packages.
- Write detailed reports on how you're using the packages and the problems they're solving for you.
- Share your successes and challenges in using our packages, to help us understand where we're excelling and where we can improve.

### Community Roles

##### Ambassador

Ambassadors evangelize the project, recruit new members, spread optimistic futurism propaganda, and help cultivate a community of individuals interested in building autonomous agents.

Suggested Tasks:
- Generate memes and propaganda to raise awareness about the project.
- Write articles and blog posts about the project.
- Maintain an active presence on social media promoting the project.
- Create videos and podcasts.
- Produce inspiring art and stories that ignite a passion for working with a group like ours.

##### Community Organizer

Community Organizers are the glue that holds our community together. They help onboard new members, moderate the Discord channel, and assist in organizing events and meetups.

Suggested Tasks:
- Assist new members in getting started with the project.
- Organize events and meetups to foster collaborative work on the project.
- Keep the Discord environment friendly and welcoming for everyone.
- Help organize the community and keep track of who is working on what.

### Business Roles

##### Business Development

The Business Development role is pivotal in identifying and creating opportunities to generate revenue. They work closely with the architects to understand the technical roadmap and identify potential areas of business. Each project is bespoke and composed of available members.

Suggested Tasks:
- Identify potential revenue streams and create a business plan.
- Develop a roadmap for the business side of the project.
- Identify and forge partnerships with other projects and companies.
- Discover and create opportunities for funding.
